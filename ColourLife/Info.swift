    "It is estimated that a person with normal colour vision can see up to 1 million distinct shades of colour, but a person who is colour blind may see as few as just 10 thousand colours (1% of the normal range). Approximately 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women have colour deficiencies, making up an estimated 300 million people worldwide who have colour vision deficiencies. As such, it is important for those who have normal colour vision to be able to empathise with those who may not be as fortunate.",
    "A person with deutan colour vision deficiency may experience confusions between colours such as green and yellow, or blue and purple. Another common symptom is that green traffic signals appear to be a very pale green or sometimes white. Common colour confusion also occurs between pink and gray or white, especially if the pink is similar to a light purple. Deuteranomaly is also the most common type of colour vision deficiency. Deutan and protan colour deficiencies are often grouped together as \"red-green colour blindness.\"",
    "A person with protan colour vision deficiency tends to see greens, yellows, oranges, reds, and browns as being more similar shades of colour than normal, especially in low light. A very common problem is that purple colours look more like blue. Another common issue is that pink colours appear to be gray, especially if the pink is a more reddish pink or salmon color. Another symptom specific to protan colour vision deficiency is that red colours look darker than normal. For example, if red text is printed on a black background, it can be very hard to read because the red appears to be very dark. Deutan and protan colour deficiencies are often grouped together as \"red-green colour blindness.\"",
    "A person with tritan colour vision deficiency does not see blue colours well, and may have difficulty seeing the difference between blue and green. Cataracts, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration can cause symptoms of tritan colour blindness. Another factor that causes reduced sensitivity to blue is the yellowing of the crystalline lens within the eye: these cells do not regenerate and over a lifetime of exposure to light, especially UV light, the lens tends to become yellow in appearance and block the transmission of blue light, interfering with colour vision. Eventually this yellowing also leads to cataracts that must be treated surgically.",
    "Achromatopsia is a rare inherited condition that causes sensitivity to bright light and loss of colour vision. Similar to other forms of colour blindness, achromatopsia can be graded as incomplete (partial) achromatopsia or complete achromatopsia (total colour blindness). Achromatopsia is often associated with light sensitivity, photophobia, and glare sensitivity. In some cases, low vision disorders such as progressive cone dystrophy or retinitis pigmentosa can cause a gradual deterioration of colour vision that eventually turns into complete achromatopsia.",
    "Blue-cone monochromacy causes severely impaired colour discrimination, low visual acuity and nystagmus. It is caused by the impaired functionality of cones in the eye sensitive to the red and green colours and is typically inherited"
